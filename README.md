Profession
======
Profession is a really simple CraftBukkit plugin that allows you to change the professions of villagers by right-clicking on them with an item in hand. With the default settings, use:

* WHEAT to change a villager into a Farmer.
* RAW BEEF to change a villager into a Butcher.
* BOOK to change a villager into a Librarian.
* IRON INGOT to change a villager into a Blacksmith.
* REDSTONE to change a villager into a Priest.
